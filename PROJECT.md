# Project Overview

## Purpose

This project exists to keep Linear aligned with Snyk DAST.

Canonical module path:

```text
github.com/tesslio/snyk-dast-linear-sync
```

Snyk DAST is the rebrand of Probely. The tool talks to the Probely REST API
(current hostnames `api.probely.com` / `app.probely.com`, both configurable)
and is forward-compatible with the Snyk DAST rebrand.

The intended outcome is:

- every relevant Snyk DAST finding has a corresponding Linear issue
- the Linear issue stays current as the Snyk DAST finding changes
- resolved or accepted/invalidated findings move to the correct Linear workflow state
- repeated runs become cheap by skipping unchanged records

This is an operational sync tool, not a generic library.

## Core Contract

The project treats Snyk DAST as the source of truth for security finding data
and Linear as the execution surface for tracking and triage.

It is responsible for:

- reading Snyk DAST findings (and the targets they belong to)
- deciding the desired Linear representation
- reconciling the current Linear state to that desired state

It is not responsible for:

- writing back to Snyk DAST
- preserving arbitrary manual edits inside the managed section of the Linear description
- syncing comments or custom fields beyond the currently managed issue body, title, priority, due date, workflow state, and managed automation label

## Identity Model

Each Snyk DAST finding is identified by:

```text
snyk-dast:<target-id>:<finding-id>
```

The `<finding-id>` is the bare numeric finding id returned by the Snyk DAST
API (the `id` field from `GET /findings/`). Global uniqueness comes from the
`snyk-dast:<target-id>:` prefix. That fingerprint is embedded in the Linear
description metadata block and is the durable join key between systems.

Without that fingerprint, the sync cannot safely deduplicate or update issues.

## Issue Lifecycle

### Create

Create a Linear issue when:

- a Snyk DAST finding exists
- no Linear issue with the same fingerprint exists

### Update

Update the Linear issue when managed fields differ:

- title
- description
- due date
- priority
- mapped state
- managed automation label

### Resolve

When a previously tracked finding no longer exists in Snyk DAST but its target
still exists, move the Linear issue to the resolved (`Done`) state.

When a previously tracked finding no longer exists because its Snyk DAST target
no longer exists, cancel the Linear issue instead.

### Conflict

If multiple Linear issues share the same fingerprint, the sync treats that as a
conflict:

- it logs the conflict
- it keeps the lowest-identifier issue as canonical and cancels the duplicates

## Description Strategy

The Linear issue description is intentionally structured for fast triage first,
deep debugging second. Snyk DAST is a DAST product, so findings describe
vulnerabilities in a scanned web application or API target rather than
source-code locations or package dependencies.

It includes:

- heading with vulnerability title and severity
- target name/host and target URL near the top
- the vulnerable request context: URL, HTTP method, path, parameter, insertion point
- CWE and CVSS score when available
- human-usable Snyk DAST UI link
- Snyk DAST REST API link
- the fix description when Snyk DAST provides one
- target and finding identifiers
- metadata block

The synced title is also structured for scanability. It leads with the scanned
target (host, falling back to target name) and the vulnerable request
(`METHOD path`).

The metadata block also records the managed automation label set when label
management is enabled.

Linear may rewrite parts of the description body when rendering or storing
markdown. The sync therefore normalizes known Linear formatting changes during
compare and cache hashing.

## Managed Labels

`LINEAR_MANAGED_LABEL` controls the label this tool manages on synced issues.

- default: `snyk-dast-automation`
- `off`: disables label management
- any other value: the exact Linear label name to manage

Behavior:

- the configured managed label is added to new synced issues
- unrelated existing labels are preserved
- if the configured managed label changes, the old managed label is removed and the new one is applied
- if label management is disabled, the previously managed label is removed

The configured label must already exist in Linear. If it does not, the run
fails with a clear operator-facing error.

`LINEAR_TARGET_TYPE_LABELS` optionally maps Snyk DAST target `type` values
(`single` for web applications, `api` for APIs) to additional managed Linear
labels.

- format: comma-separated `target_type:label` pairs
- example: `api:snyk-dast-api,single:snyk-dast-web`

`LINEAR_TARGET_TYPE_LABEL_DEFAULT` controls the fallback label for unmapped
target types.

- default: `off`
- `off`: disables the fallback

The metadata block stores the full managed label set so the sync can remove
stale target-type-derived labels while preserving unrelated manual labels.

`LINEAR_UNSUBSCRIBE_ACTOR` is an optional operator control for notification
behavior.

- default: `true`
- when enabled, the sync creates issues without subscribing the Linear API actor
- update operations preserve the current subscriber list exactly as it already exists

## State Mapping

Snyk DAST (Probely) finding states map to Linear workflow states as follows:

- `notfixed` / `retesting` -> `Todo`
- `accepted` with a future `expiration_date` (time-limited risk acceptance) -> `Todo` (SLA clock restarts from the acceptance expiry)
- `accepted` with a past `expiration_date` (lapsed risk acceptance) -> `Todo` (due date is the acceptance expiry plus the configured severity offset)
- `accepted` without an `expiration_date` (permanent risk acceptance) -> `Cancelled`
- `invalid` (false positive) -> `Cancelled`
- `fixed` -> `Done`
- missing finding in an existing Snyk DAST target -> `Done`
- missing finding because the Snyk DAST target no longer exists -> `Cancelled`

The sync also normalizes workflow naming differences such as `Canceled` vs
`Cancelled`.

A time-limited `accepted` finding is kept open in `Todo` rather than cancelled,
because it requires attention once the acceptance expires. Its due date is
calculated from the acceptance expiry date so the SLA extends to the normal
severity offset from when the acceptance ends.

A lapsed time-limited acceptance stays in `Todo` for the same reason: the
acceptance was a request to be reminded at the expiry date, so mapping the
expired state onto a permanent acceptance would cancel the ticket at exactly
the moment it becomes actionable again. Only an acceptance with no expiry at
all is treated as permanent.

Archived Linear issues are a special case. Linear auto-archives closed issues
and excludes them from the default issue query, while Snyk DAST retains
terminal findings indefinitely, so the sync must ask for archived issues
explicitly (bounded by `LINEAR_ARCHIVE_LOOKBACK_DAYS`) or it recreates a
duplicate each time a ticket leaves the snapshot — once per archive cycle rather
than on every run, since each replacement is visible until Linear archives it in
turn. Archived issues are treated as
terminal and are not mutated in place; a finding that becomes active again gets
a replacement ticket.

The replacement is a product choice, not an API constraint: Linear's
`issueUnarchive` mutation carries no documented precondition, so restoring and
updating the original ticket is a supported alternative. It was considered and
rejected — each recurrence is intended to get a clean ticket with its own SLA
clock rather than one ticket reused across recurrences.

The lookback window bounds elapsed time since **auto-**archiving, not the team's
auto-archive period (which Linear expresses in months). The two are
independent, so a short window is not made safe by a short period. It also does
not bound every archived issue: manually or API-archived issues (trashed ones
included) have `archivedAt` set with `autoArchivedAt` null, so they are returned
regardless of age. Including them can only prevent duplicates, and the pinned
`linear-api` binding has no `IssueFilter.archivedAt` to bound them with.

Since Snyk DAST retains terminal findings indefinitely, each keeps a live
desired issue forever, and any finite window eventually drops its ticket from
the snapshot — minting a duplicate that cannot be reconciled, because the
original is no longer visible to the duplicate-cancellation pass. The copies
therefore accumulate, one per cycle. `LINEAR_ARCHIVE_LOOKBACK_DAYS` defaults to
ten years for that reason: it covers the whole archive in practice, and remains
configurable only as a size/latency escape hatch.

Suppressing creates for already-terminal findings would also remove the cycle,
but was rejected: the project wants every finding to end up with a ticket,
including findings closed before the sync first ran.

### Manual Non-Terminal State Override

When a user manually moves a managed issue to any non-terminal Linear workflow
state that differs from what the sync would set, subsequent syncs preserve the
user's chosen state. This prevents the automation from fighting intentional
triage decisions.

This covers:

- a user moving an open issue from the configured open state (e.g. `Triage`) to `Todo` or `In Progress`
- a user moving a snoozed issue from `Backlog` to `Todo`
- any other non-terminal state that differs from the configured state for the desired model state

Terminal states (`Done`, `Cancelled`) are never preserved: the sync always
transitions to a terminal state when the Snyk DAST finding is fixed or
permanently accepted/invalidated, even if a user manually moved the issue to a
terminal state.

### Due Dates

Due dates are derived from the Snyk DAST finding `created_at` timestamp, not
from when the issue first appears in Linear. For time-limited `accepted`
findings (snoozed), the due date is instead calculated from the acceptance
expiry date so the SLA extends to the normal severity offset from when the
acceptance expires.

Default offsets:

- critical: 15 days
- high: 30 days
- medium: 45 days
- low: 90 days

Past due dates are left as-is. Linear renders past due dates as "overdue", and
the actual past date is more informative than flooring to today: it tells the
triager how long the issue has been past its SLA. Flooring to today would also
cause daily cache churn.

## Performance Model

The project is designed for thousands of issues.

It uses:

- concurrent Snyk DAST and Linear snapshot loading
- worker-based reconciliation
- batched Linear mutations
- rate-limit backoff
- SQLite caching

The cache is critical for steady-state performance. A healthy steady-state run
should do little or no work when nothing has changed.

### Batch Failure Handling

Linear mutations are batched, one GraphQL alias per entry, so a batch can fail
three different ways and each needs different handling to avoid duplicating
tickets:

- **Per-alias failure.** The response carries `success: false`, or omits the
  alias, while the other aliases succeeded. Note that `gqlclient` decodes the
  response body before returning any GraphQL error, so the successful aliases are
  still available even when an error is returned. Only the reported entries are
  retried; retrying the batch would duplicate the ones that already exist.
- **Ambiguous failure.** The request failed at the transport level, so nothing is
  known per entry — and crucially this does *not* prove Linear rejected the
  mutation, which may have been committed before the response was lost. Creates
  are therefore reconciled first: `ExistingFingerprints` asks Linear which of the
  batch's fingerprints now have a live issue, and only the rest are re-created.
  If that lookup also fails, nothing is retried and the entries are counted as
  failed — the next run creates whatever is genuinely missing, because the finding
  is still reported by Snyk DAST and will be absent from the next snapshot.
  Missing a ticket for one cycle is recoverable; a duplicate is only undone later
  by the duplicate-cancellation pass.
- **Ambiguous comment failure.** A comment carries no fingerprint to reconcile
  against, and a duplicated change comment is more disruptive than a missing one
  (the issue state itself is already correct), so these are counted in
  `FailedComments` and not retried.

A residual race remains by construction: Linear's `issueCreate` exposes no
idempotency key, so a write that lands between the reconciliation query and the
retry still duplicates. The duplicate-cancellation pass converges that case on a
later run.

## SQLite Cache

The SQLite cache stores:

- Snyk DAST-side normalized hashes keyed by fingerprint
- Linear-side normalized hashes keyed by fingerprint
- a schema signature for the managed issue format

The cache is used only as an optimization. It should never be the only source
used to infer real current state.

Normal behavior:

1. Read live Snyk DAST data.
2. Read live Linear data.
3. Compare both against the last successful cached hashes.
4. Skip unchanged fingerprints.
5. After successful writes, refresh the cache from the live post-write Linear snapshot.

The post-write refresh matters because Linear may rewrite markdown bodies after
mutation.

The cache fast-path never suppresses a pending move into a terminal state
(`Done`/`Cancelled`): a finding that became fixed or permanently
accepted/invalidated while its ticket sat in an open column must still be
closed, even if its hashes are unchanged since the last run.

## Safety Assumptions

- The metadata block must remain intact.
- The managed description body is owned by this tool.
- Linear issue history matters, so deleting and recreating all issues is a last resort, not a normal repair path.
- Cache bypass is the correct operator action when the rendering schema or compare logic changes.

## Operator Guidance

After any code change, run:

```bash
go fix ./...
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

Use a normal run for day-to-day sync:

```bash
go run ./cmd/snyk-dast-linear-sync --env-file .env
```

Use a dry run to inspect planned changes:

```bash
go run ./cmd/snyk-dast-linear-sync --env-file .env --dry-run
```

Use cache bypass when you intentionally changed the managed rendering or need a
full live reconciliation:

```bash
go run ./cmd/snyk-dast-linear-sync --env-file .env --bypass-cache
```

## Design Boundaries

If this project grows further, the next reasonable extensions would be:

- richer incremental Snyk DAST fetching using server timestamps where available
- more selective Linear snapshot loading if the API surface allows it safely
- richer cache statistics and observability
- explicit conflict reporting output

The current implementation is intentionally optimized for correctness first,
then steady-state efficiency.
